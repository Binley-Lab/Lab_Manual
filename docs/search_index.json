The purpose of this Lab Manual is to provide a centralized location for all resources that you may find useful/necessary when navigating your studies at the University of Manitoba. Although much of the material is geared towards students, postdocs may also find useful support resources here. I do my best to make sure that the information in this manual is up to date. However, it is the responsibility of all students: To familiarize themselves each year with the university’s academic regulations and policy in general; To familiarize themselves with the regulations and policies applying specifically to their faculty, school, or program; To familiarize themselves with the specific graduation requirements of the degree, diploma, or certificate they are seeking; and To ensure that the courses they have selected are appropriate to their programs. Please note that the university may update policies and requirements throughout your degree, so you should check in regularly to ensure you have the most up-to-date information. Please make sure you are looking at the requirements for the current year, and for the Department of Biological Sciences. It is the responsibility of all lab members to stay on top of important dates and deadlines. If you notice any inaccuracies or out of date information in this manual, please create an issue to let me know and I will update it as soon as possible. Remember that if you are uncertain about anything, you can always ask. "],["getting-started.html", "Getting Started R and RStudio Reference Management Data Management and Backup", " Getting Started R and RStudio If you are brand new to using R/Rstudio, you will need to download and install both. Once everything is installed and ready to use, I recommend starting with R for Data Science. It’s freely available and decently comprehensive - you can work your way through the chapters and will learn most of the basics you will need for coding in R. This is something you should work on in the first four months of your program if you have little to no prior experience. I do not recommend using AI to provide coding/anaylsis help unless you are very confident in your coding abilities already. AI should be viewed as a tool, and it can be useful in some contexts, but only if you can evaluate it critically. You are responsible for the code that you produce, which means you need to be able to understand and justify everything that you do. Reference Management Unless otherwise discussed, all lab members will use Zotero for reference and citation management. You can download Zotero for free here. If you are unfamiliar with Zotero, there are some useful tutorials available online. I also recommend using the Chrome or Firefox plug-in to make it easier to save papers. Please let me know if you use up the free storage space and we can upgrade it. Using reference management serves several purposes: It will save you many, many hours reformatting manuscripts to fit different journal requirements It provides a paper organization/file storage system that most likely beats whatever system you can set up manually We can create shared folders when collaborating on different projects, so that all collaborators have access to the same papers If you are having trouble getting started with Zotero, you can reach out to the UM Library or we can set up a meeting to go through it. Data Management and Backup Coming soon "],["university-of-manitoba-policies.html", "University of Manitoba Policies Academic Calendar", " University of Manitoba Policies As a student at the University of Manitoba (UM) you have rights and responsibilities. It is important for you to know what you can expect from the University as a student and to understand what the University expects from you. Become familiar with the University’s policies, procedures, and regulations specific to your faculty, college or school. The UM website’s governing documents is one important source of information, in particular the Academic and Students sections. The Student Advocacy office can also help you understand policies and procedures; find their information in the UM Learner supports section below. Academic Calendar The Academic Calendar is the University’s official publication containing course descriptions, program, and graduation requirements, as well as UM and faculty or school-specific rules, regulations, and policies. Familiarize yourself with the sections of university policies and procedures and general academic regulations. "],["funding-opportunities.html", "Funding Opportunities", " Funding Opportunities Here you will find resources related to finding additional funding to support your research. Please note that this is not a comprehensive list, but one I am slowly compiling as I come across more sources of funding. If you have any suggestions for funding sources to add to this list, please create an issue. You are responsible for keeping track of funding deadlines and requirements, and if you require a letter of reference from me, please provide me with at least two weeks notice. In Progress: This page will be updated shortly "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
