# University of Manitoba Policies {-}

As a student at the University of Manitoba (UM) you have rights and responsibilities. It is important for you to know what you can expect from the University as a student and to understand what the University expects from you. Become familiar with the University's policies, procedures, and regulations specific to your faculty, college or school. 
The UM website’s [governing documents](https://umanitoba.ca/governance/governing-documents) is one important source of information, in particular the Academic and Students sections. The Student Advocacy office can also help you understand policies and procedures; find their information in the UM Learner supports section below. 


## Academic Calendar {-}

The [Academic Calendar](https://umanitoba.ca/registrar/academic-calendar) is the University’s official publication containing course descriptions, program, and graduation requirements, as well as UM and faculty or school-specific rules, regulations, and policies. Familiarize yourself with the sections of university policies and procedures and general academic regulations.
