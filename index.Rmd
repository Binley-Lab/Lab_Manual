# About {-}

Welcome to the Binley Lab! The purpose of this Lab Manual is to provide a centralized location for all resources that you may find useful/necessary when navigating your studies at the University of Manitoba. Although much of the material is geared towards students, postdocs may also find useful support resources here.

I do my best to make sure that the information in this manual is up to date. However, it is the responsibility of all students:

* To familiarize themselves each year with the university’s academic regulations and policy in general;

* To familiarize themselves with the regulations and policies applying specifically to their faculty, school, or program;

* To familiarize themselves with the specific graduation requirements of the degree, diploma, or certificate they are seeking; and

* To ensure that the courses they have selected are appropriate to their programs.

Please note that the university may update policies and requirements throughout your degree, so you should [check in regularly](https://umanitoba.ca/graduate-studies/administration/supplementary-regulations) to ensure you have the most up-to-date information. Please make sure you are looking at the requirements for the current year, and for the Department of Biological Sciences.  



**[It is the responsibility of all lab members to stay on top of important dates and deadlines](https://catalog.umanitoba.ca/graduate-studies/important-notice/)**. If you notice any inaccuracies or out of date information in this manual, please [create an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/using-issues/creating-an-issue) to let me know and I will update it as soon as possible. Remember that if you are uncertain about anything, you can always ask.
