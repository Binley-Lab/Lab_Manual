## Program Planning {-}
- startup assignment for milestones etc.
- in any format you like, create a list of major milestones/requirements for your program 
- should include things like which courses you need to take, when certain things need to be submitted, funding opportunities that you will be eligible and their deadlines
- dates can be relatively rough - e.g., month 3 = first committee meeting, month 6 submitting proposal, etc.
